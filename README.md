# Primer on the SURF project

The following are a few exercises to gauge your understanding of cloning, troubleshooting, and data analysis in biological sciences. These skills are not taught in a classroom and are gained by practice. Please try your best to complete these exercises and detail your strategy for solving the problem. Please also note anywhere if you have any difficulties solving the problem.

## Plasmid Annotation and WTH?
The following is adapted from a real story that commonly occurs in biology labs.

Your PI is an onerously vague and mysterious person. Before leaving on a 6 month sabbatical to Antartica to photograph penguins and hunt for aliens, they ask you to run some experiments in order to study some vague phenomena of bacterial gene regulation. On your bench is a single PCR tube containing the plasmids of interest and in your email are two wholly unannotated plasmid sequences labeled control.gb and test.gb

By nature of the expedition, your PI will be out of contact for the next 6 months.

**Your task is to deduce what exactly you are being asked to study and complete those experiments before your PI comes back.**

If you are completely clueless about how to solve this problem. Don't worry. *Welcome to grad school!! ;)* Thankfully, your fellow labmates have provided you with some helpful tips for solving this problem.

* Annotate all interesting features/genes in the provided plasmid sequences
  * biobrick parts or derivatives thereof are likely heavily being used
  * bonus points if you can also identify the most likely PDB structures of the proteins being expressed
* Design the primers which will be used to identify your plasmids via colony PCR
* Specify the primers you will use to sequence verify your whole plasmid
* Use the annotated plasmid map to figure out what you are studying or testing
* Important details to know in order to perform the experiment:
    1. What resistance gene and origin of replication is the plasmid carrying. Does it even have an origin of replication? What antibiotics will be used?
    2. What reporter proteins are being used or expressed? How will I measure the signal?
    3. What inducible promoters are being used and what inducer chemical do I need to run my experiment?
    4. How will I plot and interpret the data?
